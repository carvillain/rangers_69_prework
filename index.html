<h2>About Me</h2>    
<p>I am 29 years old, and originally from Michigan. Currently I live
    in Chicago's South Loop and love it! 
</p>
<p>I have two bachelor's degrees. I attended Grand Valley State University and graduated in 2014 with <br />
   a bachelor of science in Psychology. After working briefly in a manual labor job, I decided to go <br />
   back to school and obtained a bachelor of arts in History from Michigan State University in 2016.

<h2>Previous Employment</h2>
<p>    
    Most recently I worked for Quicken Loans as an underwriter. My career with Quicken Loans lasted <br />
    from 2017 through 2021 and provided a great opportunity for an entry
    into professional life after college.<br /> In my tenure with Quicken Loans, I had 
    the fortunate opportunity to hold three positions, <br />in different parts of the business:
    <dl>
       <dt>Mortgage Loan Originator (Febuary 2017-December 2017)</dt>
       <dd>I assisted clients in obtaining creative solutions for their financial needs utilizing a 
           <br />refinance on their home.</dd>
       <dt>Credit Consultant (December 2017-March 2021)</dt>
       <dd>While employed as a credit consultant, I helped clients improve their credit scores to qualify <br />
           for or improve the pricing on a mortgage transaction.</dd>
       <dt>Credit Underwriter (March 2021-July 2021)</dt>
       <dd>As a credit underwriter, I reviewed loan applications to ensure they met guidelines and find <br />
           creative solutions if the loan application was not approved.</dd>
</p>
<p> Other than my tenure with Quicken Loans, I also spent some time selling cars at a car dealership. <br />
    That job was quite fun because I was able to work with clients face to face and the other employees <br />
    were like minded individuals. These previous positions have helped me determine that I want to get <br />
    out of the finance and customer services industries, in favor of a more technical role and the unique <br />
    challenges that comes with it.
